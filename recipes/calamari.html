        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Is calamari squid or octopus? Calamari is the Italian word for squid, a cousin to octopus. Squid is firm and white with a mild, slightly sweeter taste that lends itself to so many flavors. There are more than 300 species of squid in the world's waters, but fewer than a dozen are utilized in cooking.</p>
        <p>Squid is available in most grocery stores and, thankfully, it is not very expensive. You can find it at the fish counter but, more often, in the freezer aisle. In this calamari recipe, I used wild-caught frozen calamari tubes, which are already cleaned. Frozen calamari rings are also available and will work in this recipe.</p>
