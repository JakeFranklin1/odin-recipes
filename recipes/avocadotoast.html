        <h3>ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>&half; x 220g cherry tomatoes on the vine</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 ripe avocados</li>
            <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
            <li>6 drops hot pepper sauce, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>4 slices sourdough</li>
            <li>1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>mixed salad, to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Put the tomatoes in a small roasting tin and cook for 15 minutes, or until softened and just starting to split.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, fill a large pan with water and bring to the boil; add the vinegar. Cut the avocados in half and scoop out the flesh into a bowl (discard the stone). Add half the lime juice, the pepper sauce and some salt. Using the back of a spoon, roughly smash the avocado, until chunky but spreadable.</li>
            <li>Preheat the grill to its highest setting or set a griddle pan on the hob over a medium-high heat. Brush the sourdough slices with the oil on both sides and toast for 1-2 minutes on each side, or until lightly charred.</li>
            <li>Poach the eggs in the pan of boiling water for 2-3 minutes, until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny*. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.</li>
            <li>Spread the sourdough toasts with the smashed avocado and divide between two plates, along with the roasted tomatoes and some salad. Top each with a poached egg and season with some freshly cracked black pepper. Serve with a drizzle of hot pepper sauce, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Tip:</strong> for a great flavour combo, rustle up a red pepper, feta and rocket side salad.</p>
